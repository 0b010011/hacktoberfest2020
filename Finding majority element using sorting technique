// question is asked by some of the biggest product based companies like amazon , google etc..
// Ques :- Here we are asked to find the majority element which means an element which appears in the array more than half of its size i.e n/2



#include<iostream>
#include<vector>
#include<algorithm>


using namespace std;

 int main()

   int n;
   int c=0;
   cout<<"Enter the no. of elements in the array"<<endl;
   cin>>n;
   int B[n];

   }

   }
   
   
   sort(A.begin(),A.end());                                   // vector A getting sorted
    int mid = n/2;                                     
    
      for(int i = 0; i<n ; i++)

         if(A[i] == A[mid])                                
         c++;                                                   // no. of occurrences of the middle element being checked
   
    if(c>n/2)
    cout<<A[mid]<<" is the majority element";
